# Learning Tkinter Module
In this repo, I wanted to deep dive into the world of Tkinter. The module is built within Python and is used to create amazing GUIs. 


### Lesson One: Installing Python and Tkinter (Intro.py)
	- Python.org
	- Reviewing Tkinter official docs page
	- Browsing Examples of Tkinter GUIs

### Lesson Two: Running a basic "Hello World!" (gui.py)
	- Everything is a widget. (ie: Buttons, text, etc)
	- The root widget is the main window of the software
	- .pack() is one way to show widgets on the screen.

	
### Lesson Three: Positioning using Grid System (grid.py)
	- The interface is postitioned by using columns and rows.
	- All widgets are placed relative to each other.
	- .grid() function allows the postioning to occur

### Lesson Four: Creating Buttons in Tkinter (buttons.py)
	- padx and pady changes the sizes
	- "command" allows the function to occur on the buttons
	- "fg" - foreground, "bg" - background is used for colors. hex colors can be used as well

### Lesson Five: Creating Input Fields (inputs.py)
	- Entry() is the input field itself
	- creating entry widgets for input boxes: "e"
	- creating variables in function for output
	- .insert() is a placeholder
	- .get() grabs the input field text.
